Proposal: An online curatorial platform

Looking at existing curatorial models on the internet I was dissatisfied with the lack of interactivity and a tendency to replicate white walls on screen. Also, it feels many curators are only coming to grips with the nuances of what they are actually working with. Having not curated physical shows I hold no affinity to people being present in a room to have an engagement and experience with art.  

Updates in the thought process/concept:
1. Enrolled in Node centre for curatorial studies:
"Curating on the Web:Exhibiting Internet-based" course.
4 weeks. Starts 17 March. 4 weeks.
2. Think about sharing, and democratisation of ideas. RIP! A remix manifesto - https://www.nfb.ca/film/rip_a_remix_manifesto/
What does this really mean? Freedom of ideas.
