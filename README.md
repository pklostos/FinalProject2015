Proposal: An online curatorial platform

Looking at existing curatorial models on the internet I was dissatisfied with the lack of interactivity and a tendency to replicate white walls on screen. Also, it feels many curators are only coming to grips with the nuances of what they are actually working with. Having not curated physical shows I hold no affinity to people being present in a room to have an engagement and experience with art.  

Harnessing the capacity to build a 3D space I want to allow for the curator to customize virtual spaces and the accompanying text with ease. This allows for a roving visual representation of the exhibition or allow for implementation in temporal increments. That is, it may be weekly additions from different artists encouraging people to revisit rather than a one view scenario.

A pathway:

1. Gain a solid understanding the intricacies and ephemerality of internet based art.
2. As well, the issues around curating it.  (http://www.nodecenter.org/curating-on-the-web/)
3. Strongly consider UX and how this differs to existing models. Why would people care or actually buy in to customizing these spaces?
4. Look at modeling software used in architecture, etc to think about how a virtual space can replicate a gallery (if this is a requirement)
5. Think about the resources required for customization in future? Would a permanent coder be required? Billed? Costs?
