## Proposal: An online curatorial platform

Looking at existing curatorial models on the internet I was dissatisfied with the lack of interactivity and a tendency to replicate white walls on screen. It feels many curators are only coming to grips with the nuances of what they are actually working with. Having not curated physical shows I hold no affinity to people being present in a room to have an engagement and experience with art.  

##Updates in the thought process/concept:

1.  Enrolled in Node centre for curatorial studies:
"Curating on the Web:Exhibiting Internet-based" course.
4 weeks. Starts today.

2.  Watching documentaries such as RIP! A remix manifesto and The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz got me thinking about sharing, and democratization of ideas. Is the next step for artists to start sharing their ideas more liberally rather than guarding them for fear of being copied? Are their ideas that original to begin with. I believe that the internet could be the leveling field and shift us in to the next phase of creative consciousness.

4.  I've been particularly inspired by a few sites as models and just in general:
* https://www.seditionart.com/ -- This site represents major established artists who agree to distribute specifically created works for the internet sold in large editions. This does 2 things. First, everyone can collect art - it removes the elitist inaccessibility that occurs when they become established. They want to reverse this e.g Tracy Emin. Also, the work is created specifically for the internet, not a retrofit/afterthought. These are major artists that understand the above shift and art excited by it!

3.  In this first exhibition(Project02), I've chosen to focus on sounds artists who I think are misrepresented in galleries and online? Why? They're too long and not financially viable/popular enough for commercial galleries and most major institutions to host. Also, who actually sits through 33 mins of audio? Thinking about the internet, this allows a participant to do other things in the background and engage as they see fit. I've chosen to repurpose MOMA's online catalogue to pare back the design and consider how to give equal treatment to the artists.
